            For Your Health! is a local punk duo based in Rexburg, Idaho. Comprised of drummer Brenden Taylor and bassist/vocalist Cole Foster, the band has focused their creative endeavors on their own forthcoming genre: what they have shorthandedly dubbed "sludge rock". The band gathers musical influence from a myriad of predecessors, thus supplying them with a fresh, eclectic sound. Taking conventions from both older genres (such as disco and the youthful, rebellion-driven punk of the early 90's) as well as far newer and specific ones (such as math rock), Taylor and Foster's heavily distorted sound smacks of both funk and grunge, aiming to revive-and synthesize-the latter.

Ask someone today, and you’d probably get the same answer. “It’s like if a hardcore band and a blues band fell into radioactive sludge and came out as a disco mutant,” Taylor commented. “That’s basically what we sound like. It’s sludge rock.” - (excerpt from the <i>Rexburg Repertoire</i>)</blockquote>

            The two met, incidentally, through a Craigslist ad Foster had posted. In search of a drummer, Foster and Taylor had both been looking to bring something new to the local music scene. Foster has a particular penchant for the blues, having cut his teeth on the driven, soulful classics of the 30's. Alternatively, Taylor had recently focused on contemporary rock. The friends collaborated briefly in the fall of 2015, but busy schedules and previous engagements prevented them from meaningful and/or consistent practice. However, the pair reunited the next winter and incrementally began working on original songs and covers.
