        <blockquote cite="https://rexburgrepertoire.wordpress.com/2016/10/13/spotlight-for-your-health/">If you were to ask someone a year ago what “sludge rock” was, they probably wouldn’t have a clue. Ask someone today, and you’d probably get the same answer. “It’s like if a hardcore band and a blues band fell into radioactive sludge and came out as a disco mutant,” Taylor commented. “That’s basically what we sound like. It’s sludge rock.”</blockquote>(excerpt from the <i>Rexburg Repertoire</i>)</p>
